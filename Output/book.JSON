      "Description": "<b>The first novel in the First Law Trilogy and debut fantasy novel from <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, Joe Abercrombie.</b><br><br>Logen Ninefingers, infamous barbarian, has finally run out of luck. Caught in one feud too many, he's on the verge of becoming a dead barbarian -- leaving nothing behind him but bad songs, dead friends, and a lot of happy enemies. <br><br> Nobleman, dashing officer, and paragon of selfishness, Captain Jezal dan Luthar has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends at cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight by altogether bloodier rules. <br><br> Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta hates everyone: cutting treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room for friendship. His latest trail of corpses may lead him right to the rotten heart of government, if he can stay alive long enough to follow it. <br><br> Enter the wizard, Bayaz. A bald old man with a terrible temper and a pathetic assistant, he could be the First of the Magi, he could be a spectacular fraud, but whatever he is, he's about to make the lives of Logen, Jezal, and Glokta a whole lot more difficult. <br><br> Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are ready to be settled, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood. <br><br> <b>Unpredictable, compelling, wickedly funny, and packed with unforgettable characters, <i>The Blade Itself</i> is noir fantasy with a real cutting edge.</b><br> <b><br></b><b><br></b><b><br></b><b>First Law Trilogy</b><br> <i>The Blade Itself</i><br> <i>Before They Are Hanged</i><br> <i>Last Argument of Kings</i><br><br><br> For more from Joe Abercrombie, check out:<br><br> <b>Novels in the First Law world</b><br> <i>Best Served Cold</i><br> <i>The Heroes</i><br> <i>Red Country</i><br><i><br></i>"

White’s masterful retelling of the saga of King Arthur is a fantasy classic as legendary as Excalibur and Camelot, and a poignant story of adventure, romance, and magic that has enchanted readers for generations.</b><br> <i> </i><br> Once upon a time, a young boy called “Wart” was tutored by a magician named Merlyn in preparation for a future he couldn’t possibly imagine. A future in which he would ally himself with the greatest knights, love a legendary queen and unite a country dedicated to chivalrous values. A future that would see him crowned and known for all time as Arthur, King of the Britons.<br>  <br> During Arthur’s reign, the kingdom of Camelot was founded to cast enlightenment on the Dark Ages, while the knights of the Round Table embarked on many a noble quest. But Merlyn foresaw the treachery that awaited his liege: the forbidden love between Queen Guenever and Lancelot, the wicked plots of Arthur’s half-sister Morgause and the hatred she fostered in Mordred that would bring an end to the king’s dreams for Britain—and to the king himself.<br><br><b>“[<i>The Once and Future King</i>] mingles wisdom, wonderful, laugh-out-loud humor and deep sorrow—while telling one of the great tales of the Western world.”</b>—<b>Guy Gavriel Kay</b>"

Even the imperial legions, long inured to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. Yet Empress Laseen's rule remains absolute, enforced by her dread Claw assassins. <br><br>For Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for Tattersail, surviving cadre mage of the Second Legion, the aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities of Genabackis, yet holds out. It is to this ancient citadel that Laseen turns her predatory gaze. <br><br>However, it would appear that the Empire is not alone in this great game. Sinister, shadowbound forces are gathering as the gods themselves prepare to play their hand... <br><br>Conceived and written on a panoramic scale, <i>Gardens of the Moon </i>is epic fantasy of the highest order--an enthralling adventure by an outstanding new voice.<br><br>At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>"
